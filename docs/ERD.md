# ERD â€” TBD

The relational model (e.g., `events_raw` plus derived views) will be authored after the ingest contract is finalized.

**Principles:**
- Append-only raw table for events.
- Derived tables/materialized views for chart queries.
- Indices added based on access patterns.

*(A Mermaid ERD diagram will be added when fields are fixed.)*
